abstract="This paper presents the concept of kinematic control of prosthetic hand with 13 d.o.f., while grasping objects of different shapes and sizes. The concept refers to the process of healthy hand motion control performed by the human nervous system. Planning of grip is based on kinematic model of the hand. The parameters of subsequent phases of the gripping process were determined experimentally from the measurements carried out with a laboratory model of hand. It was assumed that the final arrangement of fingers on the workpiece is determined on the basis of information from the touch sensor system.",
